A collection of bash scripts. Simple tools for simple tasks.

These tools here are stuff I believe could be able to have some functionality in your everyday tasks. The goal is to keep improving these scripts until they reach a point when they'll become useful tools.

If you believe any of these may be useful for you feel free to take it.!!
